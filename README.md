# Rocult Executor

A Roblox executor base written engirely in Rust, aiming to be an initial proof of concept. Open sourced to be as a learning resource, as a way to give back to the resources I used to learn. The idea is that if the executor is Rust-based, it'll have all
the advantages Rust does over C++.

## Goals

- [ ] Basic L8 execution
- [ ] Execution on actors
- [ ] 100% Stability
- [ ] TP Handler
- [ ] Basic custom functions

## Further goals

- [ ] 100% sUNC
- [ ] replicatesignal
- [ ] oth hook

## Non-goals

- [ ] Injection
    > This is a base, you must bring your injector
- [ ] Undetected
    > Open sourcing something undetected is begging it to be patched
